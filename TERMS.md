Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the **Similarify** mobile application (the "App").

By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. The Service

Similarify is a tool to help you group and organize similar photos on your device. The app uses on-device algorithms to detect similar images and helps you clean up duplicates.

## 2. Your Data & Responsibility

**You are solely responsible for your photos.**

- The App suggests photos for deletion, but **you** make the final decision.
- We are not liable for any accidental loss of photos.
- Always verify photos before confirming deletion.
- On supported devices, deleted photos go to the system "Trash" first, but this is not guaranteed on all Android versions.

## 3. Usage Limits & Ads

- Users have daily operation limits (20 operations per day).
- You can earn extra operations by watching rewarded ads.
- Ad credits have **no monetary value** and cannot be refunded or exchanged.
- Ad availability depends on your region and network.

## 4. Prohibited Use

You agree not to:

- Use the App for illegal purposes.
- Reverse engineer or decompile the App.
- Use bots, scripts, or exploits to cheat the ad-reward system.

## 5. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, particularly regarding ad fraud.

## 6. Disclaimer

The App is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that:

- The similarity algorithm will be 100% accurate.
- The service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
- Deleted photos can always be recovered from Trash.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Similarify and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including data loss, lost profits, or device damage) resulting from your use of the App.

## 8. Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Republic of Turkey**.

**International Users:** If you reside in the European Union, UK, USA, or other jurisdictions with mandatory consumer protection laws, you retain your statutory rights under local law. Nothing in these Terms limits those rights.

## 9. Changes to Terms
