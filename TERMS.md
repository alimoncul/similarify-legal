## 1. The Service

Similarify is a tool to help you group and organize similar photos on your device. The app uses on-device algorithms to detect similar images and helps you clean up duplicates.

## 2. Your Data & Responsibility

**You are solely responsible for your photos.**

- The App suggests photos for deletion, but **you** make the final decision.
- We are not liable for any accidental loss of photos.
- Always verify photos before confirming deletion.
- On supported devices, deleted photos go to the system "Trash" first, but this is not guaranteed on all Android versions.

## 3. Usage Limits & Ads

- Free users have daily operation limits.
- You can earn extra operations by watching rewarded ads.
- Ad credits have **no monetary value** and cannot be refunded or exchanged.
- Ad availability depends on your region and network.

## 4. Premium Purchase

- Premium is a **one-time purchase** that unlocks unlimited operations forever.
- Purchases are processed through Google Play and are subject to Google's refund policies.
- Premium status is tied to your Google account and can be restored on any device.
- We do not offer refunds outside of Google Play's refund policy.

- Use bots, scripts, or exploits to cheat the ad-reward system.
- Attempt to bypass purchase verification.

## 6. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, particularly regarding ad fraud or purchase manipulation.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Republic of Turkey**.

**International Users:** If you reside in the European Union, UK, USA, or other jurisdictions with mandatory consumer protection laws, you retain your statutory rights under local law. Nothing in these Terms limits those rights.
